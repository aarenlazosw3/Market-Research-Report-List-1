<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE for Caps and Closures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection Molding</li><li>Compression Molding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) is widely used in the caps and closures market due to its strength, durability, and resistance to chemicals. There are two primary manufacturing processes: injection molding and compression molding. Injection molding involves injecting molten HDPE into molds to create precise shapes, ideal for complex designs and high-volume production. In contrast, compression molding uses heat and pressure to shape HDPE, suitable for thicker, more robust caps but often less precise. Both methods cater to diverse packaging needs in various industries.</p></p>
