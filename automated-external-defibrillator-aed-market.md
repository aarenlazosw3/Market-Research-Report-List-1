<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automated External Defibrillator (AED) market can be categorized into two main types: semi-automated and fully automated devices. Semi-automated AEDs require the user to deliver the shock after the device analyzes the heart rhythm, providing voice prompts throughout the process. In contrast, fully automated AEDs independently analyze the heart rhythm and deliver a shock without user intervention, making them easier to use in emergency situations. Both types enhance rapid response in cardiac arrest scenarios, improving survival rates.</p></p>
